<h3>Things you will need</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Eggroll or Springroll wraps</li>
    <li>1lb Ground beef</li>
    <li>1/3 cup bacon bits</li>
    <li>1 Medium onion (Diced)</li>
    <li>3 cloves of garlic (Minced)</li>
    <li>1/4 Cup of sweet pickle relish</li>
    <li>At least one cup of cold water</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1 Tbs Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>1.5 cups of shredded cheddar cheese</li>
  </ul>
<p><b>Seasoning tips:</b> Season to taste, I usually use steak seasoning, <br> Salt, Pepper, and Cayenne pepper. But you can season it however you like</p>
<h3>Process</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350°F.</li>
    <li>Cook the ground beef, diced onions, minced garlic, and bacon bits in a frying pan for approximately 6 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. <br> <i>You can also add in any prefered seasoning.</i></li>
    <li>Remove the beef from the surface.</li>
    <li>While the beef is cooling, add in 1.5 cups of shredded cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup of sweet pickle relish. Mix in the cheese and ground beef and cover to let the cheese melt.</li>
  </ol>
<h3>Assembly</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Once the cheese is melted lay out the eggroll wraps <i> or the springroll wraps.</i></li>
    <li>Put a decent amount of the ground beef filling diagonally in the center of the eggroll wraps.</li>
    <li>Wet all four edges of the wrap.</li>
    <li>Fold in the edges and roll it into the shape of an eggroll</li>
    <li>Repeat this process until there is no more filling left or until you lose the motivation.</li>
    <li>Once the eggrolls are finished put them on a greased baking dish and brush the egg on top of the eggrolls.</li>
    <li><b>Optional:</b> Add sesame seeds on the top to garnish.</li>
    <li>Bake at 350°F for about 10 minutes or until the top is golden and crispy</li>
  </ol>
<p>These eggrolls are best served with a store bought cheese sauce. you could also serve with traditional condiments such as ketchup, mayonnaise, or mustard.</p>
